# KYC-Know-Your-Company-

We are not your traditional company, you know us, we do not know you. 

In a traditional sense a company would know information about you as the customer, in this new
model we are striving to eliminate knowledge of you the potential customer/user. This is important
for privacy, operation security, as well as a peace of mind to know we are not holding your data.


Right now we accept BTC via actual bitcoin and encourage you to mix your coins via Whirlpool by 
Samourai, we also accept PayPal. With regards to BTC payments you are receiving the service provisioned
nodes based on type without us knowing you. With PayPal we do not see anything as our software simply 
checks whether or not an order is pending. We collect no data or store no data. PayPal may collect 
data but this is necessary for them as that is their business model. We at Cypherpunk Labs care about 
your privacy as well as security. 

As we accept bitcoin payments it is important to note for auditing purposes an address may change as we
use a sepcific address per SKU(Node type, duration, and soon region), this is critical for us to be transparent
on our activities. So below is a list of our wallets per type and duration for the current time. As we rotate
wallets for whatever reason they will be notated and updated here in this README.md along with the block
height of the change. Example

```
exit_1m - $address

```

Post change would look like this

```
exit_1m - $new_address - $block_height_of_change

```


We do this to be as transparent as possible as we do not collect data on you so in exchange you should have insights into us.
We know address reuse is dangerous however in this case to run a business we use this wallet approach for auditing purposes 
of our inventory of peers and SLA needs of each. As we can not explicitly tie it to you the user. 


# Bitcoin Wallets

Below are the list of bitcoin addresses as well as their inventory association. We use our own node and software automation
for the checks to verify payment and confirmation numbers so that our automation software can launch what you have requested.

Please check back here to find the wallets and information if you wish to track how many orders and of what types. Again we have
no access to the shells of hidden services and special nodes(you will be provided shell access in a trustless fashion, outline of this
process will be made available once we launch them). 


Each day our automation software sends the Bitcoin to our Coinbase so that we can pay for capacity and such(necessary fiat usage). We encourage
you to understand we do not want to know you support us with knowing your btc and or order. Keep that to you to protect yourself. 


As we venture onward into this seemingly uncharted territory we will be including as much information for you all to know us, not the other way around.
